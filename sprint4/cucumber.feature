  Scenario: As a tester i would like to unlearnAll
    Given Environment is up and running
		When  unlearnAll
		Then  The Response of Test2 should answers with insert form

  Scenario Outline: As a Tester I would like to unlearn the previously learned response in the middle of a sequence
  	Then The Response of <request> answers with <response> with <responseMime>

    Examples: 
      | request                        | response | responseMime       |

	Scenario: Test to delete a state and then continue number responses
		When Unlearn the request
		When Unlearn the request
  	Then The Response of "number" answers with "4" with "text/plain"
  	Then The Response of "number" answers with "4" with "text/plain"
  	Then The Response of "number" answers with "4" with "text/plain"
  	Then The Response of "number" answers with "4" with "text/plain"
		

  Scenario: Learn a new response and then unlearn it
  
    Given Environment is up and running
    When  Learn that request Test2 should answer with Yes
    And   Unlearn the request
    Then  The Response of Test2 should answers with insert form
